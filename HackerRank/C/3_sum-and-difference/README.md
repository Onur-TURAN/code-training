# Sum and Difference of Two Numbers

## Difficulty level of the problem "EASY"

---

## Task

### Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

Declare _4_ variables: two of type int and two of type float.
Read _2_ lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your _4_ variables.
Use the "+" and "-" operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

## Soluotion

### Firstly

#### We need to determine what we need. We need definitions of type "integer" for integer values and "float" for decimals. So we create 2 types values with this commands "int" and "float". Also, Question want 4 values, our need to create 4 input for values.

### Secondary 

#### The "if" function was used because a condition was required for the values entered to start the mathematical operation in the task.

### Finally

#### Instead of creating new values that we can print the result we obtained for the math operation, assigning and printing the values we have will reduce the memory usage.

### NOTE:

#### While memory usage isn't very important for this question, paying attention to this issue is important for both coderuntime and cleancode.
