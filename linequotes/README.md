# Line Quotes Formatter

This Python script reads a text file, processes each line by adding double quotes around it, and then writes the formatted lines back to the same file.

## How It Works

1. The script reads the contents of a file named `line.txt`.
2. Each line in the file is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
3. Double quotes are added around each line, and a comma and newline are appended.
4. The formatted lines are written back to the same file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Place the `line.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using Python.

### Example

Suppose `line.txt` contains the following lines:
